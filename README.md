# Memory Click Game

## Overview
The Memory Click Game is a front-end game application created using React. Play begins by clicking on one of twelve images. From there the cards are randomly rearranged using a durstenfeld shuffle to randomize array items and a map method on a React card component to refresh cards on the page. The game dynamics and score system were handled using methods within the app.js class object. The player wins by clicking on each of the twelve cards only once. Once a card is clicked twice, the game is reset i.e. the player loses. Look below for a runthrough of the game.
